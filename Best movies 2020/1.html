                <p>
                    First Cow, Kelly Reichardt's evocative and wise tale of frontier life, 
                    begins with the discovery of two skeletons in the woods. 
                    An unnamed young woman (Arrested Development's Alia Shawkat) and 
                    her dog -- echoing the human-and-canine pair at the center of Reichardt's 2008 road story 
                    Wendy and Lucy -- come upon the bones in the modern day Pacific Northwest. 
                    Then we flash back to a time when the Oregon territory was far less developed, 
                    an era of perilous opportunity and rampant exploitation, and meet Cookie (John Magaro), 
                    a bashful and unassuming cook for a team of unruly fur trappers. Eventually, 
                    he befriends the wandering King-Lu (Orion Lee), a Chinese immigrant who claims to be fleeing some Russians.
                    The two stumble on an opportunity to make some money: a wealthy landowner (Toby Jones) 
                    brings the first cow to the region. Cookie and King-Lu decide to steal the cow's milk 
                    at night and use it to bake sweet honey biscuits, which they sell at the local market.
