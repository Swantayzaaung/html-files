Not a lot of people realise that dogs and cats can get sunburnt. This means that they do not think about protecting their pets when the sun is out. Light-coloured dogs and cats or those without a lot of hair are particularly at risk. Vets advise that the best preventative measure is to keep your pet indoors while the sun is at its hottest – between 11:00am and 3:00pm. They also advise that, just like humans, sunscreen or sunblock can be applied to protect them.
