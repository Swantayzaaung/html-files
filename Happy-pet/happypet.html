                        Not a lot of people realise
                        that dogs and cats can get
                        sunburnt. This means that
                        they do not think about 
                        protecting their pets when
                        the sun is out. Light-
                        coloured dogs and cats or
                        those without a lot of hair
                        are particularly at risk. Vets
                        advise that the best
                        preventative measure is to
                        keep your pet indoors while
                        the sun is at its hottest -
                        between 11:00am and
                        3:00pm. They also advise
                        that, just like humans,
                        sunscreen or sunblock can
                        be applied to protect them.</p>

                        Most people think puppies
                        are cute little bundles of fun
                        â€“ and they are.  However,
                        they can also be
                        destructive. Chewing
                        appears to be a major
                        hobby of theirs! Chewing is
                        very important when
                        puppies are teething. They
                        are just like babies where
                        chewing can help to break
                        the skin on the gums and
                        help to bring forward the
                        teeth. </p>
