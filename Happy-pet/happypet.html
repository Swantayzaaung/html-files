                        Not a lot of people realise<br> 
                        that dogs and cats can get<br>
                        sunburnt. This means that<br>
                        they do not think about <br>
                        protecting their pets when<br>
                        the sun is out. Light-<br>
                        coloured dogs and cats or<br>
                        those without a lot of hair<br>
                        are particularly at risk. Vets<br>
                        advise that the best<br> 
                        preventative measure is to<br> 
                        keep your pet indoors while<br> 
                        the sun is at its hottest -<br> 
                        between 11:00am and<br> 
                        3:00pm. They also advise<br>
                        that, just like humans,<br> 
                        sunscreen or sunblock can<br> 
                        be applied to protect them.</p>

                        Most people think puppies<br> 
                        are cute little bundles of fun<br> 
                        â€“ and they are.  However,<br>
                        they can also be<br> 
                        destructive. Chewing<br> 
                        appears to be a major<br>
                        hobby of theirs! Chewing is<br> 
                        very important when<br> 
                        puppies are teething. They<br> 
                        are just like babies where<br> 
                        chewing can help to break<br> 
                        the skin on the gums and<br> 
                        help to bring forward the<br> 
                        teeth. </p>
