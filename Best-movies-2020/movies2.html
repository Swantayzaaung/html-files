                    <h2>2. Bacurau</h2>
                    <p>When a movie tells a story about a community joining together to fight off outside 
                    invaders, there are certain shots, moments, and heroics you want to see. 
                    Bloodshed, vengeance, and justice all have a place in Bacurau, a feverish, 
                    quasi-dystopian genre mash-up centered around a fictional Brazilian city in 
                    the country's Northwestern region, but the film doles out its cathartic showdowns in an 
                    inventive, dizzying manner. <br><br>
                    After a stretch exploring the geography, political realities, 
                    and daily routines of the city, a scheming American villain arrives and, in an inspired bit 
                    of casting, he's played by B-movie staple Udo Kier, reveling in the cruelty and complexity 
                    of the role. He's leading a team of aspiring would-be commandos, the type of people who 
                    view killing as a novel thrill.</p>
