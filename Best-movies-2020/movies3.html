                    <h2>3. Never Rarely Sometimes Always</h2>
                    <p>The Port Authority bus terminal provides the backdrop for a good deal of the drama and 
                    the waiting in Eliza Hittman's powerful portrait of a teenager traveling from Pennsylvania
                    to New York to have an abortion, a procedure she can't receive in her home state. <br><br>
                    Quiet and watchful, Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) observes the world around her from benches, 
                    bus seats, and doctor's office chairs, dragging an enormous suitcase through the drab 
                    interiors of various midtown locations. She doesn't tell her parents about her pregnancy 
                    or her trip. She's joined by her cousin Skylar (Talia Ryder), who wants to be a supportive 
                    friend and sounding board. </p>
