<p>
When a movie tells a story about a community joining together to fight off outside 
invaders, there are certain shots, moments, and heroics you want to see. 
Bloodshed, vengeance, and justice all have a place in Bacurau, a feverish, 
quasi-dystopian genre mash-up centered around a fictional Brazilian city in 
the country's Northwestern region, but the film doles out its cathartic showdowns in an 
inventive, dizzying manner.</p> 
<p>After a stretch exploring the geography, political realities, 
and daily routines of the city, a scheming American villain arrives and, in an inspired bit 
of casting, he's played by B-movie staple Udo Kier, reveling in the cruelty and complexity 
of the role. He's leading a team of aspiring would-be commandos, the type of people who 
view killing as a novel thrill.</p>
