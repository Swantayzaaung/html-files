<b>3. Never Rarely Sometimes Always</font></b>
<p>
The Port Authority bus terminal provides the backdrop for a good deal of the drama and 
the waiting in Eliza Hittman's powerful portrait of a teenager traveling from Pennsylvania
to New York to have an abortion, a procedure she can't receive in her home state. </p>
<p>
Quiet and watchful, Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) observes the world around her from benches, 
bus seats, and doctor's office chairs, dragging an enormous suitcase through the drab 
interiors of various midtown locations. She doesn't tell her parents about her pregnancy 
or her trip. She's joined by her cousin Skylar (Talia Ryder), who wants to be a supportive 
friend and sounding board.
